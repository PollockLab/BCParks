# BC Parks

This repository contains code to make maps and figures for the BC Biodiversity Program.

This repository also contains the beginnings of a Sampling priority index, including code to calculate spatial, taxonomic, and purpose-oriented scores to generate sampling priority index maps for BC Parks.

## Objective & approach

- Summarise contributions of the summer teams to iNaturalist data in BC
- Predict hotspots for next year's sampling

## More about this project

- Read more about the [BC Biodiversity Program](https://www.bcinat.com/).
- Umbrella project with all BC Parks data: [link](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/bc-parks)
- Umbrella project with summer field teams: [link](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/bc-big-summer-teams)

## Data

- Spatial layers and iNaturalist data needed to run the cell-wise scoring script are compressed in `data/for_scoring.zip`.
- Other data layers that are hosted privately on the lab's Sharepoint.
